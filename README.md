This project demonstrates how to control a brushless motor using a relay with an LED indicator and three different operational modes: forward, backward, and auto.

## Introduction

Brushless motors are widely used in various applications due to their efficiency, reliability, and high power-to-weight ratio. This project provides examples of controlling a brushless motor using a relay with an LED indicator and implementing different operating modes.

## How it Works

Brushless motors are electronically commutated motors where the direction of rotation is controlled by the sequence of energizing the motor phases. By changing the sequence of energizing the motor phases, the direction of rotation can be reversed.

## Getting Started

To get started with controlling a brushless motor and implementing different modes, you will need the following components:

- Brushless motor
- Relay module
- LED
- Microcontroller or single-board computer (e.g., Arduino)
- Power supply for the motor and microcontroller
- Jumper wires or connectors for wiring

## Steps

Follow these steps to control the brushless motor with different modes:

1. Connect the brushless motor to the relay module output terminals.
2. Connect the relay module input pins to the microcontroller's GPIO pins.
3. Connect the LED to the relay module to indicate the motor's operation mode.
4. Write code to control the relay module and LED.

## Connection

The specific wiring connections depend on the relay module, LED, and microcontroller used. Refer to the datasheets and documentation for each component for detailed wiring instructions.
